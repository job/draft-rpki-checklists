        The protected CMS content type is intended to provide for the creation and validation of an RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC), a checksum listing signed with a specific set of Internet Number Resources.
        The objective is to allow an attestation that, when validated, provides a means to confirm a given Internet resource holder produced the RSC.
      </t>
      <t>
        Signed Checklists are expected to facilitate inter-domain business use cases that depend on an ability to verify resource holdership.
        RPKI-based validation processes are expected to become the industry norm for automated Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) on-boarding or establishment of physical interconnections between Autonomous Systems (ASes).
      </t>
      <t>
        The RSC concept borrows heavily from Resource Tagged Attestation (RTA) <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta"/>, Manifests <xref target="RFC9286"/>, and OpenBSD's signify utility <xref target="signify"/>.
        The main difference between an RSC and RTA is that the RTA profile allows multiple signers to attest a single digital object through a checksum of its content, while the RSC profile allows a single signer to attest the content of multiple digital objects.
        A single signer profile is considered a simplification for both implementers and operators.

because Section 4.8.8.2 of [RFC6487] states, "This extension MUST be present

        To validate an RSC, the RP <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform all the validation checks specified in <xref target="RFC6488"/> (except for checking for the presence of an SIA extension, which <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be present in the EE X.509 certificate (see <xref target="RFC6487" section="4.8.8.2"/>)) and perform the following additional RSC-specific validation steps:
      </t>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The contents of the CMS eContent field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> conform to all of the constraints described in <xref target="econtent"/>, including the constraints described in <xref target="FileNameAndHash"/>.
        </li>

Otherwise, verification <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> proceed in "filename-unaware" mode.

              <t>
                One or more FileNameAndHash elements <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be found with a matching hash value; otherwise, verification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fail, and the error <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be reported to the user.

        Note that in the above procedure, not all elements of checkList necessarily need be used. That is, it is not an error if the length of checkList is greater than the size of the set of digital objects to be verified.

      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>
        When creating digital objects of a plain-text nature (such as ASCII, UTF-8, HTML, Javascript, and XML), converting such objects into a lossless compressed form is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.
        Distributing plain-text objects within a compression envelope (such as GZIP <xref target="RFC1952"></xref>) might help avoid unexpected canonicalization at intermediate systems (which in turn would lead to checksum verification errors).
        Validator implementations are expected to treat a checksummed digital object as string of arbitrary single octets.
      </t>

<!-- [rfced] We are having trouble understanding how the text after the
semicolon relates to the rest of the sentence. May we update as follows?

Current: 
   If a fileName field is present, but no digital object within the set
   of to-be-verified digital objects has a filename that matches the
   content of that field, a validator implementation SHOULD compare the
   message digest of each digital object to the value from the hash
   field of the associated FileNameAndHash and report matches to the
   user for further consideration; or report an error indicating no file
   by that name exists.

Perhaps:
   If a fileName field is present but no digital object within the set
   of to-be-verified digital objects has a filename that matches the
   content of that field, a validator implementation SHOULD compare the
   message digest of each digital object to the value from the hash
   field of the associated FileNameAndHash and then either report matches to the
   user for further consideration or report an error indicating no file
   by that name exists.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        RPs are hereby warned that the data in an RSC is self-asserted.
        When determining the meaning of any data contained in an RSC, RPs <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> make any assumptions about the signer beyond the fact that it had sufficient control of the issuing CA to create the object.
        These data have not been verified by the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the CA certificate to the entity that issued the EE certificate used to validate the Signed Checklist.
      </t>
      <t>
        RPKI certificates are not bound to real-world identities; see <xref target="RFC9255"/> for an elaboration.
        RPs can only associate real-world entities to Internet Number Resources by additionally consulting an exogenous authority.
        Signed Checklists are a tool to communicate assertions 'signed with Internet Number Resources' and do not communicate any other aspect of the resource holder's business operations, such as the identity of the resource holder itself.
      </t>
      <t>
        RSC objects are not distributed through the RPKI repository system.
        From this, it follows that third parties who do not have a copy of a given RSC may not be aware of the existence of that RSC.
        Since RSC objects use EE certificates but all other currently defined types of RPKI object profiles are published in public CA repositories, an observer may infer from discrepancies in the repository that RSC object(s) may exist.
        For example, if a CA does not use random serial numbers for certificates, an observer could detect gaps between the serial numbers of the published EE certificates.
        Similarly, if the CA includes a serial number on a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) that does not match any published object, an observer could postulate an RSC EE certificate was revoked.
      </t>

<!-- [rfced] Should "serial" here read "serial number"? Also, will the text in
parentheses be clear to readers?

Original:
   Nor does an arbitrary (to the RP unknown) serial in a CRL
   imply an RSC object exists: 

Perhaps:
   Nor does an arbitrary serial number (or one that is unknown to the RP) in a CRL
   imply an RSC object exists: 
-->

      <t>
        Conversely, a gap in serial numbers does not imply that an RSC exists.
        Nor does an arbitrary (to the RP unknown) serial in a CRL imply an RSC object exists: the implicitly referenced object might not be an RSC, it might have never been published, or it may have been revoked before it was visible to RPs.
        In general, it is not possible to confidently infer the existence or non-existence of RSCs from the repository state without access to a given RSC.
      </t>
      <t>
        While a one-time-use EE certificate must only be used to generate and sign a single RSC object, CAs technically are not restricted from generating and signing multiple different RSC objects with a single key pair.
        Any RSC objects sharing the same EE certificate cannot be revoked individually.

<!-- [rfced] We have included some specific questions about the IANA text in
the document.  In addition to responding to those questions, please
review all of the IANA-related updates carefully and let us know if any
updates are needed.


a) Section 9.4: FYI - We updated "id-mod-rpkiSignedChecklist-2021" to
"id-mod-rpkiSignedChecklist-2022" to match the registry at
https://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers/smi-numbers.xhtml#security-smime-0. 


b) Section 9.5: FYI - We updated the registry name here from "Provisional
Standard Media Type" to "Media Types" per https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/.

Original:
   The IANA has registered the media type application/rpki-checklist in
   the "Provisional Standard Media Type" registry as follows:
   
Updated:
   IANA has registered the media type application/rpki-checklist in
   the "Media Types" registry as follows:


c) Section 9.5: Please confirm that "Section 5" is correct here. Or was the
intent to cite the "Security Considerations" section of this document (i.e.,
Section 8)?

Original:
      Security considerations: Carries an RPKI Signed Checklist
          [RFC-to-be]. This media type contains no active
          content. See Section 5 of [RFC-to-be] for further
          information.


d) Section 9.5: We made several updates to the registration in this section.

- Added the following item per the template in Section 5.6
of RFC 6838:

   Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

- Updated "None" to "N/A" per Section 5.6 of RFC 6838, which states:

   "N/A", written exactly that way, can be used in any field if desired
   to emphasize the fact that it does not apply or that the question was
   not omitted by accident.  Do not use 'none' or other words that could
   be mistaken for a response.

- Added "N/A" to the "Macintosh file type code(s)" field because it was not
populated.

- Made some punctuation edits.

Please review and let us know any objections. We will request that IANA update
the registration at
https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/rpki-checklist to
match the edited document prior to publication.


e) We updated some section titles to be the name of the registry in that
section as that seemed to be the overall pattern. Please let us know any
objections.

<!-- [rfced] Terminology

a) We see "Signed Checklist" and "RPKI Signed Checklist" (as well as the
acronym "RSC") used in the document. Please review and let us know if any
updates are needed for consistency. (Note that "Signed Checklist" is used in
the IANA registries in Sections 9.2 and 9.3; if any changes are made that
affect these registries, we will ask IANA to update accordingly prior to
publication.)


b) We note inconsistencies in the terms listed below. We chose the form on the
right.  Please let us know any objections.

EE Certificate vs. EE certificate
  Note: "EE certificate" is more common in the RFC Series (e.g., RFCs 9286, 8360,
  8211, and 6488).

Resource Holder vs. resource holder
  Note: The lowercase form is used in RFC 6488 and elsewhere in the RFC Series.

RPKI Repository vs. RPKI repository
  Note: The lowercase form is more common in the RFC Series (e.g., RFCs 9286, 6486,
  6487, and 6841).

Repository vs. repository


c) Both of the following forms appear in the document. Which is the correct
placement of "X.509"? Should "X.509" come before "EE certificate"?

X.509 End-Entity (EE) certificate

EE X.509 certificate


d) We see the following forms used in the document. Please review and let us
know if any updates are needed for consistency.

rpkiSignedChecklist vs. RpkiSignedChecklist

checklist vs. checkList
  Note: We believe that "checklist" is for general use and "checkList" is the name
        of the field, but please check for correct use.

file name vs. filename vs. fileName
   Note: We believe that "file name" and "filename" are for general use and "fileName"
   is the name of the field, but please check for correct use.


e) We see the following forms, which vary slightly. Please review and let us
know if any updates are needed.

signed "with resources"

signed with a specific set of Internet Number Resources

'signed with Internet Number Resources'


f) It seems that quotation marks are not used for most field names (e.g., the
asID field, the ipAddrBlocks field). However, quotation marks (single and
double) are used for field names in the following sentences. Should the
quotation marks here be removed?

Original:
   ConstrainedASIdentifiers is a SEQUENCE, consisting of a single field
   "asnum", itself containing a SEQUENCE OF one or more ASIdOrRange
   instances as defined in [RFC3779].
   ...
   The AS identifiers present in the eContent
   'resources' field MUST be a subset of those present in the
   certificate extension.
   ...
   If the ipAddrBlocks field is present within the contents of the
   'resources' field, then the IP Resources extension [RFC3779] MUST
   be present in the EE certificate contained in the CMS
   certificates field.  The IP addresses present in the eContent
   'resources' field MUST be a subset of those present in the
   certificate extension.
