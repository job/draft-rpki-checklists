        This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile for a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'), for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
        The objective is to allow an attestation, in the form of a listing of one or more checksums of arbitrary digital objects (files), to be signed "with resources", and for validation to provide a means to confirm a specific Internet Resource Holder produced the Signed Checklist.
        The profile is intended to provide for the signing of an arbitrary checksum listing with a specific set of Internet Number Resources.

      <t>
        This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/> profile for a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'), for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6480"/>.
        The objective is to allow an attestation, in the form of a listing of one or more checksums of arbitrary files, to be signed "with resources", and for validation to provide a means to confirm a given Internet Resource Holder produced the RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC).
        The profile is intended to provide for the signing of a checksum listing with a specific set of Internet Number Resources.
      </t>

      <t>
        Signed Checklists are expected to facilitate inter-domain business use-cases which depend on an ability to verify resource holdership.
        RPKI-based validation processes are expected to become the industry norm for automated Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) on-boarding or establishment of physical interconnection between Autonomous Systems.
      </t>

      <t>
        The RSC concept borrows heavily from <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta">RTA</xref>, Manifests <xref target="RFC6486"/>, and OpenBSD's <xref target="signify"/> utility.
        The main difference between RSC and RTA is that the RTA profile allows multiple signers to attest a single digital object through a checksum of its content, while the RSC profile allows a single signer to attest the existence of multiple digital objects.
        A single signer profile is considered a simplification for both implementers and operators.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="profile">
      <name>RSC Profile and Distribution</name>

      <t>
        RSC follows the Signed Object Template for the RPKI <xref target="RFC6488"/> with one exception.
        Because RSCs MUST NOT be distributed through the global RPKI Repository system, the Subject Information Access (SIA) extension MUST be omitted from the RSC's X.509 End-Entity (EE) certificate.
      </t>

      <t>
        What constitutes suitable transport for RSC files is deliberately unspecified.
        It might be a USB stick, a web interface secured with conventional HTTPS, PGP-signed email, a T-shirt printed with a QR code, or a carrier pigeon.
      </t>

      <section title="RSC End-Entity Certificates">
        <t>
          The CA MUST only sign one RSC with each EE Certificate, and MUST generate a new key pair for each new RSC.
          This form of use of the associated EE Certificate is termed a "one-time-use" EE certificate <xref target="RFC6487" section="3"/>.

      <name>The RSC ContentType</name>

      <t>
        The ContentType for an RSC is defined as rpkiSignedChecklist, and has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.48.
      </t>

      <t>
        This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute in the signerInfo object (see <xref target="RFC6488"/>).

    <section anchor="econtent">

      <name>The RSC eContent</name>
      <t>

      </section>

      <section>
        <name>resources</name>
        <t>
          The resources contained here are the resources used to mark the attestation, and MUST be a subset of the set of resources listed by the EE Certificate carried in the CMS certificates field.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the asID field is present, it MUST contain an instance of ConstrainedASIdentifiers.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the ipAddrBlocks field is present, it MUST contain an instance of ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each of ConstrainedASIdentifiers and ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks are specified such that the resulting DER encoded data instances are binary compatible with, respectively, ASIdentifiers and IPAddrBlocks defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.
        </t>

        <section>
          <name>ConstrainedASIdentifiers type</name>

          <t>
            ConstrainedASIdentifiers is a SEQUENCE, constisting of a single field "asnum", itself containing a SEQUENCE OF one or more ASIdOrRange instances as defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.
          </t>

          <t>
            ConstrainedASIdentifiers is defined such that the resulting DER encoded data are binary compatible with ASIdentifiers defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.

          <name>ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks type</name>

          <t>
            ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks is a SEQUENCE OF one or more instances of ConstrainedIPAddressFamily.
          </t>

          <t>
            There MUST be only one instance of ConstrainedIPAddressFamily per unique AFI.
          </t>

          <t>
            The elements of ConstrainedIPAddressFamily MUST be ordered by ascending addressFamily values (treating the octets as unsigned numbers).
            Thus, when both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are specified, the IPv4 addresses MUST precede the IPv6 addresses (since the IPv4 AFI of 0001 is less than the IPv6 AFI of 0002).
          </t>

          <t>
            ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks is defined such that the resulting DER encoded data are binary compatible with IPAddrBlocks defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.

            <section>
              <name>addressFamily field</name>
              <t>
                The addressFamily field is an OCTET STRING containing a two-octet Address Family Identifier (AFI), in network byte order.
                Unlike <xref target="RFC3779">IPAddrBlocks</xref>, a third octet containing a SAFI MUST NOT be present.
                AFIs and SAFIs are specified in [IANA-AFI] and [IANA-SAFI], respectively.

                The addressesOrRanges element is a SEQUENCE OF (one or more) IPAddressOrRange values, as defined in <xref target="RFC3779"/>.
                The rules for canonicalization and encoding defined in <xref target="RFC3779">section 2.2.3.6</xref> apply of the value of addressesOrRanges.

          This field is a sequence of FileNameAndHash objects.
          There is one FileNameAndHash entry for each arbitrary object referenced on the Signed Checklist.
          Each FileNameAndHash is an ordered pair of the name of the directory entry containing the digital object and the message digest of the digital object.
          The filename field is OPTIONAL.

      <name>RSC Validation</name>

      <t>
        Before a Relying Party can use an RSC to validate a set of digital objects, the Relying Party MUST first validate the RSC.
        To validate an RSC, the Relying Party MUST perform all the validation checks specified in <xref target="RFC6488" /> (except checking for the presence of a SIA extension), and perform the following additional RSC-specific validation steps:
      </t>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The RSC specification deviates from <xref target="RFC6487" section="4.8.8.2"/>, the Subject Information Access extension MUST NOT be present on the End-Entity (EE) certificate signing the RSC.
        </li>
        <li>
          The IP Addresses and AS Identifiers extension <xref target="RFC3779"/> is present in the end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the RSC), and each IP address prefix(es) and/or AS Identifier(s) in the RSC is contained within the set of IP addresses specified by the EE Certificate's IP Addresses and AS Identifiers delegation extension.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each FileNameAndHash entry in the RSC, if a filename field is present, the field's content MUST contain only characters specified in the Portable Filename Character Set as defined in <xref target="POSIX"/>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <t>
        To verify a set of digital objects with an RSC:
      </t>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The message digest of each referenced digital object, using the digest algorithm specified in the the digestAlgorithm field, MUST be calculated and MUST match the value given in the messageDigest field of the associated FileNameAndHash, for the digital object to be considered as verified with the RSC.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <name>Operational Considerations</name>

      <t>
        When creating digital objects of a plain-text nature (such as ASCII, UTF-8, HTML, Javascript, XML, etc) it is RECOMMENDED to convert such objects into a lossless compressed form.
        Distributing plain-text objects within a compression envelope (such as <xref target="RFC1952">GZIP</xref>) might help avoid unexpected canonicalization at intermediate systems (which in turn would lead to checksum verification errors).
        Validator implementations are expected to treat a checksummed digital object as string of arbitrary single octets.
      </t>

      <t>
        If a filename field is present, but no referenced digital object has a filename that matches the content of that field, a validator implementation SHOULD compare the message digest of each digital object to the value from the messageDigest field of the associated FileNameAndHash, and report matches to the client for further consideration.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>

      <t>
        Relying parties are hereby warned that the data in a RPKI Signed Checklist is self-asserted.
        When determining the meaning of any data contained in an RPKI Signed Checklist, Relying Parties MUST NOT make any assumptions about the signer beyond the fact that it had sufficient control of the issuing CA to create the object.
        These data have not been verified by the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the CA certificate to the entity that issued the EE Certificate used to validate the Signed Checklist.
      </t>

      <t>
        RPKI Certificates are not bound to real world identities, see <xref target="I-D.ymbk-sidrops-rpki-has-no-identity"/> for an elaboration.
        Relying Parties can only associate real world entities to Internet Number Resources by additionally consulting an exogenous authority.
        Signed Checklists are a tool to communicate assertions 'signed with Internet Number Resources', not about any other aspect of the resource holder's business operations such as the identity of the resource holder itself.
      </t>

      <t>
        RSC objects are not distributed through the RPKI Repository system.
        From this, it follows that third parties who do not have a copy of a given RSC, may not be aware of the existence of that RSC.
        Since RSC objects use EE Certificates, but all other currently defined types of RPKI object profiles are published in public CA repositories, an observer may infer from discrepancies in the Repository that RSC object(s) may exist.
        For example, if a CA does not use random serial numbers for Certificates, an observer could detect gaps between the serial numbers of the published EE Certificates.
        Similarly, if the CA includes a serial number on a CRL that does not match any published object, an observer could postulate an RSC EE Certificate was revoked.
      </t>
      <t>
        Conversely, a gap in serial numbers does not imply that an RSC exists.
        Nor does an arbitrary (to the RP unknown) serial in a CRL imply an RSC object exists: the implicitly referenced object might not be a RSC, it might never have been published, or was revoked before it was visible to RPs.
        In general, it is not possible to confidently infer the existence or non-existence of RSCs from the Repository state without access to a given RSC.
      </t>
      <t>
        While an one-time-use EE Certificate must only be used to generate and sign a single RSC object, CAs technically are not restricted from generating and signing multiple different RSC objects with a single keypair.
        Any RSC objects sharing the same EE Certificate can not be revoked individually.
      </t>

      <name>Implementation status</name>

      <t>
        This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
        The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
        Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
        Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
        This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
        Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
      </t>

      <t>
        According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
        It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".
