     A profile for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Signed
                            Checklists (RSC)
                     draft-ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc-09

Abstract

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
   content type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
   (RPKI) to carry a general purpose listing of checksums (a
   &#39;checklist&#39;).  The objective is to allow an attestation, termed an
   RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC), which contains one or more checksums of
   arbitrary digital objects (files) that are signed &quot;with resources&quot;,
   and which, when validated, confirms that the respective Internet
   Resource Holder produced the RSC.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   [RFC6268] protected content type for a general purpose listing of
   checksums (a &#39;checklist&#39;), for use with the Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].  The protected CMS content type is
   intended to provide for the creation and validation of an RPKI Signed
   Checklist (RSC): a checksum listing signed with a specific set of
   Internet Number Resources.  The objective is to allow an attestation
   that, when validated, provides a means to confirm a given Internet
   Resource Holder produced the RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC).

   Signed Checklists are expected to facilitate inter-domain business
   use-cases which depend on an ability to verify resource holdership.
   RPKI-based validation processes are expected to become the industry
   norm for automated Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) on-boarding or
   establishment of physical interconnection between Autonomous Systems.

   The RSC concept borrows heavily from RTA [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta],
   Manifests [RFC9286], and OpenBSD&#39;s [signify] utility.  The main
   difference between RSC and RTA is that the RTA profile allows
   multiple signers to attest a single digital object through a checksum
   of its content, while the RSC profile allows a single signer to
   attest the content of multiple digital objects.  A single signer
   profile is considered a simplification for both implementers and
   operators.

2.  RSC Profile and Distribution

   RSC follows the Signed Object Template for the RPKI [RFC6488] with
   one exception: because RSCs MUST NOT be distributed through the
   global RPKI Repository system, the Subject Information Access (SIA)
   extension MUST be omitted from the RSC&#39;s X.509 End-Entity (EE)
   certificate.

   What constitutes suitable transport for RSC files is deliberately
   unspecified.  It might be a USB stick, a web interface secured with
   conventional HTTPS, PGP-signed email, a T-shirt printed with a QR
   code, or a carrier pigeon.

2.1.  RSC End-Entity Certificates

   The Certification Authority (CA) MUST only sign one RSC with each
   End-Entity (EE) Certificate, and MUST generate a new key pair for
   each new RSC.  This form of use of the associated EE Certificate is
   termed a &quot;one-time-use&quot; EE certificate Section 3 of [RFC6487].

3.  The RSC ContentType

   The ContentType for an RSC is defined as rpkiSignedChecklist, with
   Object Identifier (OID) 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.48.

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

4.  The RSC eContent

   The content of an RSC indicates that a checklist for arbitrary
   digital objects has been signed &quot;with resources&quot;.  An RSC is formally
   defined as:

   RpkiSignedChecklist-2022
     { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549)
       pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) mod(0)
       id-mod-rpkiSignedChecklist-2022(73) }

   DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::=

     checkList             SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF FileNameAndHash }

   FileNameAndHash ::= SEQUENCE {
     fileName              PortableFilename OPTIONAL,
     hash                  Digest }

   PortableFilename ::=
     IA5String (FROM(&quot;a&quot;..&quot;z&quot; | &quot;A&quot;..&quot;Z&quot; | &quot;0&quot;..&quot;9&quot; | &quot;.&quot; | &quot;_&quot; | &quot;-&quot;))

   ResourceBlock ::= SEQUENCE {
     asID         [0]      ConstrainedASIdentifiers OPTIONAL,
     ipAddrBlocks [1]      ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks OPTIONAL }
     -- at least one of asID or ipAddrBlocks MUST be present
     ( WITH COMPONENTS { ..., asID PRESENT} |
       WITH COMPONENTS { ..., ipAddrBlocks PRESENT } )

   ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks ::=
     SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF ConstrainedIPAddressFamily

   ConstrainedIPAddressFamily ::= SEQUENCE {
     addressFamily         OCTET STRING (SIZE(2)),
     addressesOrRanges     SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF IPAddressOrRange }

   ConstrainedASIdentifiers ::= SEQUENCE {
     asnum [0]             SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF ASIdOrRange }

   END

4.1.  version

   The version number of the RpkiSignedChecklist MUST be 0.

4.2.  resources

   The resources contained here are the resources used to mark the
   attestation, and MUST be a subset of the set of resources listed by
   the EE Certificate carried in the CMS certificates field.

   If the asID field is present, it MUST contain an instance of
   ConstrainedASIdentifiers.

   If the ipAddrBlocks field is present, it MUST contain an instance of
   ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks.

   At least one of asID or ipAddrBlocks MUST be present.

   Each of ConstrainedASIdentifiers and ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks are
   specified such that the resulting DER-encoded data instances are
   binary compatible with, respectively, ASIdentifiers and IPAddrBlocks
   defined in [RFC3779].

   Implementations encountering decoding errors whilst attempting to
   read DER-encoded data using this specification SHOULD be aware of the
   possibility that the data may have been encoded using an
   implementation intended for use with [RFC3779].  Such data may
   contain elements prohibited by the current specification.

   Attempting to decode the errored data using the more permissive
   specification conatained in [RFC3779] may enable implementors to
   gather additional context for use when reporting errors to the user.

   However, implementations MUST NOT ignore errors resulting from the
   more restrictive definitions contained herein: in particular, such
   errors MUST cause the validation procedure described in Section 5 to
   fail.

4.2.1.  ConstrainedASIdentifiers type

   ConstrainedASIdentifiers is a SEQUENCE, constisting of a single field
   &quot;asnum&quot;, itself containing a SEQUENCE OF one or more ASIdOrRange
   instances as defined in [RFC3779].

   ConstrainedASIdentifiers is defined such that the resulting DER-
   encoded data are binary compatible with ASIdentifiers defined in
   [RFC3779].

4.2.2.  ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks type

   ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks is a SEQUENCE OF one or more instances of
   ConstrainedIPAddressFamily.

   There MUST be only one instance of ConstrainedIPAddressFamily per
   unique AFI.

   The elements of ConstrainedIPAddressFamily MUST be ordered by
   ascending addressFamily values (treating the octets as unsigned
   numbers).  Thus, when both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are specified, the
   IPv4 addresses MUST precede the IPv6 addresses (since the IPv4 AFI of
   0001 is less than the IPv6 AFI of 0002).

   ConstrainedIPAddrBlocks is defined such that the resulting DER-
   encoded data are binary compatible with IPAddrBlocks defined in
   [RFC3779].

4.2.2.1.  ConstrainedIPAddressFamily type

4.2.2.1.1.  addressFamily field

   The addressFamily field is an OCTET STRING containing a two-octet
   Address Family Identifier (AFI), in network byte order.  Unlike
   IPAddrBlocks [RFC3779], a third octet containing a SAFI MUST NOT be
   present.  AFIs are specified in [IANA.ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS].

4.2.2.1.2.  addressesOrRanges field

   The addressesOrRanges element is a SEQUENCE OF one or more
   IPAddressOrRange values, as defined in [RFC3779].  The rules for
   canonicalization and encoding defined in Section 2.2.3.6 of [RFC3779]
   apply to the value of addressesOrRanges.

4.3.  digestAlgorithm

   The digest algorithm used to create the message digest of the
   attested digital object(s).  This algorithm MUST be a hashing
   algorithm defined in [RFC7935].

4.4.  checkList

   This field is a SEQUENCE OF one or more FileNameAndHash values.
   There is one FileNameAndHash entry for each digital object referenced
   on the Signed Checklist.

4.4.1.  FileNameAndHash

   Each FileNameAndHash is an ordered pair of the name of the directory
   entry containing the digital object and the message digest of the
   digital object.

   The fileName field is OPTIONAL.  This is to allow Signed Checklists
   to be used in a &quot;stand-alone&quot; fashion in which nameless digital
   objects are addressed directly through their respective message
   digest rather than through a file system abstraction.

   If the fileName field is present then its value:

   *  MUST contain only characters specified in the Portable Filename
      Character Set as defined in [POSIX].

   *  MUST be unique with respect to the other FileNameAndHash elements
      of checkList for which the fileName field is also present.

   Conversely, if the fileName field is omitted, then the value of the
   hash field MUST be unique with respect to the other FileNameAndHash
   elements of checkList for which the fileName field is also omitted.

5.  RSC Validation

   Before a Relying Party can use an RSC to validate a set of digital
   objects, the Relying Party MUST first validate the RSC.  To validate
   an RSC, the Relying Party MUST perform all the validation checks
   specified in [RFC6488] (except checking for the presence of an SIA
   extension, which MUST NOT be present in the EE X.509 certificate
   Section 4.8.8.2 of [RFC6487]), and perform the following additional
   RSC-specific validation steps:

   1.  The contents of the CMS eContent field MUST conform to the
       constraints described in Section 4.  In particular, for each
       FileNameAndHash element in the checkList field, its contents MUST
       conform to the constraints described in Section 4.4.1.

   2.  If the asID field is present within the contents of the resources
       field, then the AS Resources extension [RFC3779] MUST be present
       in the EE certificate contained in the CMS certificates field.
       The AS identifiers present in the resources field MUST be a
       subset of those present in the certificate extension.

   3.  If the ipAddrBlocks field is present within the contents of the
       resources field, then the IP Resources extension [RFC3779] MUST
       be present in the EE certificate contained in the CMS
       certificates field.  The IP address resources present in the
       resources field MUST be a subset of those present in the
       certificate extension.

6.  Verifying files or data using RSC

   To verify a set of digital objects with an RSC:

   *  The RSC MUST be validated acording to the procedure described in
      Section 5.  If the RSC cannot be validated, verification MUST fail
      and the error SHOULD be reported to the user.

   *  For every digital object to be verified:

      1.  If the verification procedure is provided with a file name for
          the object being verified (e.g. because the user has provided
          a file system path from which to read the object) then
          verification SHOULD proceed in &quot;filename-aware&quot; mode.
          Otherwise, verification SHOULD proceed in &quot;filename-unaware&quot;
          mode.

          Implementations MAY provide an option to override the
          verification mode, for example to ignore the fact that the
          object is to be read from a file.

      2.  The message digest MUST be computed from the file contents or
          data using the digest algorithm specified in the
          digestAlgorithm field of the RSC.

      3.  The digest computed in step 2 MUST be compared to the value
          appearing in the hash field of all FileNameAndHash elements of
          the checkList field of the RSC.

          One or more FileNameAndHash elements MUST be found with a
          matching hash value, otherwise verification MUST fail and the
          error SHOULD be reported to the user.

      4.  If the mode selected in step 1 is &quot;filename-aware&quot; then
          exactly one of the FileNameAndHash elements matched in step 3
          MUST contain a fileName field value exactly matching the file
          name of the object being verified.

          Alternatively, if the mode selected in step 1 is &quot;filename-
          unaware&quot; then exactly one of the FileNameAndHash elements
          matched in step 3 MUST have the fileName field omitted.

          Otherwise, verification MUST fail, and the error SHOULD be
          reported to the user.

   Note that in the above procedure, not all elements of checkList
   necessarily need be used.  That is, it is not an error if the length
   of checkList is greater than the size of the set of digital objects
   to be verified.  However, in this situation, implementations SHOULD
   issue a warning to the user, allowing for corrective action to be
   taken if necessary.

7.  Operational Considerations

   When creating digital objects of a plain-text nature (such as ASCII,
   UTF-8, HTML, Javascript, XML, etc) it is RECOMMENDED to convert such
   objects into a lossless compressed form.  Distributing plain-text
   objects within a compression envelope (such as GZIP [RFC1952]) might
   help avoid unexpected canonicalization at intermediate systems (which
   in turn would lead to checksum verification errors).  Validator
   implementations are expected to treat a checksummed digital object as
   string of arbitrary single octets.

   If a fileName field is present, but no referenced digital object has
   a filename that matches the content of that field, a validator
   implementation SHOULD compare the message digest of each digital
   object to the value from the hash field of the associated
   FileNameAndHash, and report matches to the client for further
   consideration.

8.  Security Considerations

   Relying parties are hereby warned that the data in a RPKI Signed
   Checklist is self-asserted.  When determining the meaning of any data
   contained in an RPKI Signed Checklist, Relying Parties MUST NOT make
   any assumptions about the signer beyond the fact that it had
   sufficient control of the issuing CA to create the object.  These
   data have not been verified by the Certificate Authority (CA) that
   issued the CA certificate to the entity that issued the EE
   Certificate used to validate the Signed Checklist.

   RPKI Certificates are not bound to real world identities, see
   [RFC9255] for an elaboration.  Relying Parties can only associate
   real world entities to Internet Number Resources by additionally
   consulting an exogenous authority.  Signed Checklists are a tool to
   communicate assertions &#39;signed with Internet Number Resources&#39;, not
   about any other aspect of the resource holder&#39;s business operations
   such as the identity of the resource holder itself.

   RSC objects are not distributed through the RPKI Repository system.
   From this, it follows that third parties who do not have a copy of a
   given RSC, may not be aware of the existence of that RSC.  Since RSC
   objects use EE Certificates, but all other currently defined types of
   RPKI object profiles are published in public CA repositories, an
   observer may infer from discrepancies in the Repository that RSC
   object(s) may exist.  For example, if a CA does not use random serial
   numbers for Certificates, an observer could detect gaps between the
   serial numbers of the published EE Certificates.  Similarly, if the
   CA includes a serial number on a CRL that does not match any
   published object, an observer could postulate an RSC EE Certificate
   was revoked.

   Conversely, a gap in serial numbers does not imply that an RSC
   exists.  Nor does an arbitrary (to the RP unknown) serial in a CRL
   imply an RSC object exists: the implicitly referenced object might
   not be a RSC, it might never have been published, or was revoked
   before it was visible to RPs.  In general, it is not possible to
   confidently infer the existence or non-existence of RSCs from the
   Repository state without access to a given RSC.

   While an one-time-use EE Certificate must only be used to generate
   and sign a single RSC object, CAs technically are not restricted from
   generating and signing multiple different RSC objects with a single
   keypair.  Any RSC objects sharing the same EE Certificate can not be
   revoked individually.

9.  Implementation status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, &quot;this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit&quot;.

   *  A signer and validator implementation [rpki-rsc-demo] written in
      Perl based on OpenSSL was provided by Tom Harrison from APNIC.

   *  A signer implementation [rpkimancer] written in Python was
      developed by Ben Maddison.

   *  Example .sig files were created by Job Snijders with the use of
      OpenSSL.

   *  A validator implementation based on OpenBSD rpki-client and
      LibreSSL was developed by Job Snijders.

   *  A validator implementation [FORT] based on the FORT validator was
      developed by Alberto Leiva for a previous version of this
      specification.

10.  IANA Considerations
