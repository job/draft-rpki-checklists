  Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) object profile for Signed
                            Checklist (RSC)
                     draft-ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc-04

Abstract

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile
   for a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'), for use
   with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  The objective is
   to allow an attestation, in the form of a listing of one or more
   checksums of arbitrary digital objects (files), to be signed "with
   resources", and for validation to provide a means to confirm a
   specific Internet Resource Holder produced the Signed Checklist.  The
   profile is intended to provide for the signing of an arbitrary
   checksum listing with a specific set of Internet Number Resources.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   profile for a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'),
   for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].
   The objective is to allow an attestation, in the form of a listing of
   one or more checksums of arbitrary files, to be signed "with
   resources", and for validation to provide a means to confirm a given
   Internet Resource Holder produced the RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC).
   The profile is intended to provide for the signing of a checksum
   listing with a specific set of Internet Number Resources.

   Signed Checklists are expected to facilitate inter-domain business
   use-cases which depend on an ability to verify resource holdership.
   RPKI-based validation processes are expected to become the industry
   norm for automated Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) on-boarding or
   establishment of physical interconnection between Autonomous Systems.

   The RSC concept borrows heavily from RTA [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta],
   Manifests [RFC6486], and OpenBSD's [signify] utility.  The main
   difference between RSC and RTA is that the RTA profile allows
   multiple signers to attest a single digital object through a checksum
   of its content, while the RSC profile allows a single signer to
   attest the existence of multiple digital objects.  A single signer
   profile is considered a simplification for both implementers and
   operators.

2.  RSC Profile and Distribution

   RSC follows the Signed Object Template for the RPKI [RFC6488] with
   one exception.  Because RSCs MUST NOT be distributed through the
   global RPKI repository system, the Subject Information Access (SIA)
   extension MUST be omitted from the RSC's X.509 EE certificate.

   What constitutes suitable transport for RSC files is deliberately
   unspecified.  It might be a USB stick, a web interface secured with
   conventional HTTPS, PGP-signed email, a T-shirt printed with a QR
   code, or a carrier pigeon.

3.  The RSC ContentType

   The ContentType for an RSC is defined as rpkiSignedChecklist, and has
   the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.48.

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

4.  The RSC eContent

   The content of an RSC indicates that a checklist for arbitrary
   digital objects has been signed "with resources".  An RSC is formally
   defined as:

   RpkiSignedChecklist-2021
     { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549)
       pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) mod(0) TBD }

       ipAddrBlocks [1]       IPList OPTIONAL }
       -- at least one of asID or ipAddrBlocks MUST be present
       ( WITH COMPONENTS { ..., asID PRESENT} |
         WITH COMPONENTS { ..., ipAddrBlocks PRESENT } )

   IPAddressFamilyItem ::= SEQUENCE {    -- AFI &amp; optional SAFI --
      addressFamily        OCTET STRING (SIZE (2..3)),
      iPAddressOrRange     IPAddressOrRange }

   END

4.1.  version

   The version number of the RpkiSignedChecklist MUST be 0.

4.2.  resources

   The resources contained here are the resources used to mark the
   attestation, and MUST match the set of resources listed by the EE
   certificate carried in the CMS certificates field.

4.3.  digestAlgorithm

   The digest algorithm used to create the message digest of the
   attested digital object.  This algorithm MUST be a hashing algorithm
   defined in [RFC7935].

4.4.  checkList

   This field is a sequence of FilenameAndHash objects.  There is one
   FilenameAndHash entry for each arbitrary object referenced on the
   Signed Checklist.  Each FilenameAndHash is an ordered pair of the
   name of the directory entry containing the digital object and the
   message digest of the digital object.  The filename field is
   OPTIONAL.

5.  RSC Validation

   Before a relying party can use an RSC to validate a set of digital
   objects, the relying party MUST first validate the RSC.  To validate
   an RSC, the relying party MUST perform all the validation checks
   specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following additional RSC-
   specific validation steps.

Internet-Draft            RPKI Signed Checklist                 May 2021


   *  The IP Addresses and AS Identifiers extension [RFC3779] is present
      in the end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the RSC), and
      each IP address prefix(es) and/or AS Identifier(s) in the RSC is
      contained within the set of IP addresses specified by the EE
      certificate's IP address delegation extension.

   *  For each FilenameAndHash entry in the RSC, if a filename field is
      present, the field's content MUST contain only characters
      specified in the Portable Filename Character Set as defined in
      [POSIX].

   To validate a set of digital objects against an RSC:

   *  The message digest of each referenced digital object, using the
      digest algorithm specified in the the digestAlgorithm field, MUST
      be calculated and MUST match the value given in the messageDigest
      field of the associated FilenameAndHash, for the digital object to
      be considered valid as against the RSC.

6.  Operational Considerations

   When creating digital objects of a plain-text nature (such as ASCII,
   UTF-8, HTML, Javascript, XML, etc) it is RECOMMENDED to convert such
   objects into a lossless compressed form.  Distributing plain-text
   objects within a compression envelope (such as GZIP [RFC1952]) might
   help avoid unexpected canonicalization at intermediate systems (which
   in turn would lead to checksum verification errors).  Validator
   implementations are expected to treat a checksummed digital object as
   string of arbitrary single octets.

   If a filename field is present, but no referenced digital object has
   a filename that matches the content of that field, a validator
   implementation SHOULD compare the message digest of each digital
   object to the value from the messageDigest field of the associated
   FilenameAndHash, and report matches to the client for further
   consideration.

7.  Security Considerations

   Relying parties are hereby warned that the data in a RPKI Signed
   Checklist is self-asserted.  When determining the meaning of any data
   contained in an RPKI Signed Checklist, Relying Parties MUST NOT make
   any assuptions about the signer beyond the fact that it had
   sufficient control of the issuing CA to create the object.  These
   data have not been verified by the Certificate Authority (CA) that
   issued the CA certificate to the entity that issued the EE
   certificate used to validate the Signed Checklist.

Internet-Draft            RPKI Signed Checklist                 May 2021


   RPKI Certificates are not bound to real world identities, see
   [I-D.ymbk-sidrops-rpki-has-no-identity] for an elaboration.  Relying
   Parties can only associate real world entities to Internet Number
   Resources by additionally consulting an exogenous authority.  Signed
   Checklists are a tool to communicate assertions 'signed with Internet
   Number Resources', not about any other aspect of the resource
   holder's business operations such as the identity of the resource
   holder itself.

   RSC objects are not distributed through the global RPKI repository
   system, so whether a given CA is making use of them is not
   immediately apparent from the state of the repository.  However,
   because RSC objects depend on EE certificates, and because all
   existing applications for EE certificates involve their publication
   in the repository, an observer may be able to infer indirectly from
   the state of the repository that RSC objects are in use.  For
   example, if the CA sets the serial number on a new EE certificate to
   be one greater than the serial number used for the previous EE
   certificate, then an observer could infer that RSCs are in use if
   there is a gap between serial numbers used in published EE
   certificates.  Similarly, if the CA includes an unpublished serial
   number in a CRL, an observer could infer that an RSC object has been
   revoked.

8.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   *  A signer and validator implementation [rpki-rsc-demo] written in
      Perl based on OpenSSL was provided by Tom Harrison from APNIC.

Internet-Draft            RPKI Signed Checklist                 May 2021


B.2.  changes from -02 -> -03

   *  Reference the IANA assigned OID

   *  Clarify validation rules

B.3.  changes from -01 -> -02

   *  Clarify RSC is part of a puzzle, not panacea.  Thanks Randy & Russ

B.4.  changes from -00 -> -01

   *  Readability improvements

   *  Update document category to match the registry allocation policy
      requirement.

B.5.  individual submission phase

   *  On-the-wire change: the 'Filename' switched from 'required' to
      'optional'.  Some SIDROPS Working Group participants proposed a
      checksum itself is the most minimal information required to
      address digital objects.
